# RNASeq_UC

The objective of this project is to explore a publicly available transcriptomics dataset (bulk RNASeq). Biopsies were collected from multiple regions of the colon from 12 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. 

Four biopsies were collected from each patient, from inflamed and non-inflamed areas of the colon.
The entirety of the data (count matrix and associated metadata) can be downloaded from GEO: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE107593. The Series Matrix TXT file should be used to extract the study metadata variables.
